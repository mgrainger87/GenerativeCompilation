    // Move the value of int1 (x0) to a temporary register (for example, x4)

    // Move the value from the temporary register to another register (simulate the local variables a and b)

    // Similarly, move the value of double2 (d1) to a temporary floating-point register (for example, d8)
    fmov d8, d1

    // Move the value from the temporary register to another register (simulate the local variables x and y)
    fmov d9, d8

    // Store the value from d9 to the memory location pointed to by outDouble (x3)
