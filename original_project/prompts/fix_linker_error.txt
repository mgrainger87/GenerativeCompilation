Unfortunately, I got a linker error:
Undefined symbols for architecture arm64:
  "_customFunction", referenced from:
	  _main in tmp50flhap9.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)

 Fix the error. Remember: 
- Follow the arm64 calling convention strictly. Write out which registers are used for which parameters before generating the assembly.
- Preserve the values of caller-saved and/or callee-saved registers where necessary.
- Mangle function names according to Clang conventions for C (not C++).
- Align functions appropriately for arm64.
- Follow arm64 convention for local labels starting with a numeric value, which makes them assembler-local.
- Before branching for a function call, be sure to save all required registers.
- Use only valid arm64 instructions. ARM64 assembly does not allow direct floating-point literals with the fadd instruction.
