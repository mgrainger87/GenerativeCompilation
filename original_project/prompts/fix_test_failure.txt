Unfortunately, I got an incorrect result when testing the generated code:

Inputs:
	Integer 1: 0
	Integer 2: 0
	Double 1: 10.000000
	Double 2: 5.000000
Expected outputs:
	Integer: 0
	Double: 5.000000
Actual outputs:
	Integer: 0
	Double: -10.000000

Trace through the optimized assembly with these inputs to find the problem. If, at any time, you find an error, correct the assembly, print out the new assembly, and then trace again starting at the beginning.
