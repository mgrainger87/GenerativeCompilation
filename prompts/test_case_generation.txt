For the C function “customFunction” below, generate 10 test cases that exercise its functionality.

Write a Python version of customFunction and use it to test your test cases.

Output those test cases in a .csv file named test_data.csv according to the given format. The number of iterations should always be 100.

Numerical values should not be outside the range of the int type on an LP64 platform. All of the integer values should be output in a format that can be read by the C atoi() function. All of the double values should be written in a format that preserves precision as much as possible and can be read by the C atof() function.


CSV format:

int1,int2,double1,double2,expectedInt,expectedDouble,iterations

Function:


void customFunction(int int1, int int2, 
					double double1, double double2, 
					int *outInt, double *outDouble) {
	*outInt = int1 * 1 + 0;
	*outDouble = double1 * 1.0 + 0.0;
}
